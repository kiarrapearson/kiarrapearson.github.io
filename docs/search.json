Lastly, we use a new term called nrow that will tell the number of rows it was in from the data set.\n\n\nCode\n# 11) Answer this question with a single numeric answer, and show the R code you\n# used to reach that answer: How many members in the dataset who are holdouts on impeachment\n# come from districts with a GDP below the national figure?\n# Hint: there's a function called nrow() that tells you how many rows are in a dataframe\n\nimpeach %>% \n  filter(for_impeachment == \"YES\") %>% \n  filter(gdp_above_national == \"BELOW\") %>% \n  nrow()\n\n\n[1] 83"
